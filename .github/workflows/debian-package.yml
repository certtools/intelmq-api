    name: A build on different Debian distributions
    strategy:
      matrix:
        codename: ['bullseye']  # Only bullseye contains all dependencies

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # this does not currently work:
    # - name: Debian package action test
    #  uses: schacht-certat/action-build-on-debian@v4
    #  with:
    #    codename: ${{ matrix.codename }}

    # therefore, also this won't make sense:
    # - name: Upload artifacts
    #  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    #  with:
    #    name: debian-package-${{ matrix.codename }}-${{ github.sha }}
